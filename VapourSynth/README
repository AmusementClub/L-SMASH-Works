                * This function uses libavcodec as video decoder and libavformat as demuxer.
            [Arguments]
                + source
                    The path of the source file.
                + stream_index (default : -1)
                    The stream index to open in the source file.
                    The value -1 means trying to get the video stream which has the largest resolution.
                + threads (default : 0)
                    Same as 'threads' of LibavSMASHSource().
                + cache (default : 1)
                    Create the index file (.lwi) to the same directory as the source file if set to 1.
                    The index file avoids parsing all frames in the source file at the next or later access.
                    Parsing all frames is very important for frame accurate seek.
                + cachefile (default : source + ".lwi")
                    The filename of the index file (where the indexing data is saved).
                + seek_mode (default : 0)
                    Same as 'seek_mode' of LibavSMASHSource().
                + seek_threshold (default : 10)
                    Same as 'seek_threshold' of LibavSMASHSource().
                + dr (default : 0)
                    Same as 'dr' of LibavSMASHSource().
                + fpsnum (default : 0)
                    Same as 'fpsnum' of LibavSMASHSource().
                + fpsden (default : 1)
                    Same as 'fpsden' of LibavSMASHSource().
                + variable (default : 0)
                    Same as 'variable' of LibavSMASHSource().
                + format (default : "")
                    Same as 'format' of LibavSMASHSource().
                + repeat (default : 1)
                    Reconstruct frames by the flags specified in video stream if set to non-zero value.
                    Additionally, if set to 1, and source file requested repeat and the filter is unable to obey the request, this filter will fail explicitly to eliminate any guesswork.
                    Note that this option is ignored when VFR->CFR conversion is enabled.
                + dominance : (default : 0)
                    Which field, top or bottom, is displayed first.
                        - 0 : Obey source flags
                        - 1 : TFF i.e. Top -> Bottom
                        - 2 : BFF i.e. Bottom -> Top
                    This option is enabled only if one or more of the following conditions is true.
                        - 'repeat' is set to 1.
                        - There is a video frame consisting of two separated field coded pictures.
                + decoder (defalut : "")
                    Same as 'decoder' of LibavSMASHSource().
                + prefer_hw (default : 0)
                    Same as 'prefer_hw' of LibavSMASHSource().
                + ff_loglevel (default : 0)
                    Same as 'ff_loglevel' of LibavSMASHSource().
                + cachedir (default : DEFAULT_CACHEDIR)
                    Create *.lwi file under this directory with names encoding the full path to avoid collisions. Set to "" to restore the previous behavior (storing *.lwi along side the source video file).

        [Version]
            Version()
                * This function returns a dict containing the following keys:
                    + version: lsmas version
                    + config: extra configuration options used during meson build.
                    + ffmpeg_version: the ffmpeg version used.
